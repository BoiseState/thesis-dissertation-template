Customized style files for Computer Science Masters thesis/project or PhD dissertation
reports. Approved by the Graduate College at Boise State University.

The main LaTeX style file is bsu-cs.cls. You can leave it in the same folder as your
LaTeX thesis document folder.  The file bsu-thesis-dissertation-template.tex provides
a template for the thesis/project report that you should use as a starting point. The
bsu-thesis-dissertation-template.pdf file shows a finished PDF version of the template LaTeX
file. For writing a thesis/dissertaton/project proposal see the template bsu-proposal.tex

You can upload these files to Overleaf to use web-based LaTeX.

On Linux, you can use [kile](https://kile.sourceforge.io/) for a nice GUI for LaTeX. For the
command line, use the script mylatex provided in this folder to generate PDF properly from
LaTeX document.

On Windows, you can get the [MikTEX](miktex.org) package and use the style files provided
here.

The thesis/project style files are maintained by Amit Jain. Please contact Amit with any
additional questions. Thanks to Mike Stark for a complete rewrite and Alex Feldman with
help in maintenance.
