Customized style files for Computer Science Masters thesis/project reports. Approved by the
Graduate College at Boise State University.

The main LaTeX style file is bsu-ms.cls. You can leave it in the same folder as your LaTeX
thesis document folder.  The file bsu-thesis-project-template.tex provides a template for the
thesis/project report that you should use as a starting point. The bsu-thesis-project-template.pdf
file shows a finished PDF version of the template LaTeX file.

Or simply grab the zip file
[stylefiles.zip](https://github.com/BoiseState/thesis-project-template/blob/master/stylefiles.zip),
which contains everything you need.

On Linux, you can use [kile](https://kile.sourceforge.io/) for a nice GUI for LaTeX. For the
command line, use the script mylatex provided in this folder to generate PDF properly from
LaTeX document.

On Windows, you can get the [MikTEX](miktex.org) package and use the style files provided
here.

The thesis/project style files are maintained by Amit Jain. Please contact Amit with any
additional questions. Thanks to Mike Stark for a complete rewrite and Alex Feldman with
help in maintenance.
