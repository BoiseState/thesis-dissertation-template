Customized style class file and template for Computer Science Masters thesis/project or PhD
dissertation reports. Approved by the Graduate College at Boise State University.

The main LaTeX style file is bsu-cs.cls. You can leave it in the same folder as your LaTeX
thesis document folder.  The file bsu-thesis-dissertation-template.tex provides a template
for the thesis/dissertation/project report that a student should use as a starting point. The
bsu-thesis-dissertation-template.pdf file shows a finished PDF version of the template LaTeX
file.  For writing a thesis/dissertation/project proposal a new template will be released soon. 

You can upload these files to Overleaf to use web-based LaTeX.

On Linux, you can use [kile](https://kile.sourceforge.io/) for a nice GUI for LaTeX. For the
command line, use `pdflatex` to generate PDF properly from LaTeX document.

On Windows, you can get the [MikTEX](miktex.org) package and use the style files provided
here.
