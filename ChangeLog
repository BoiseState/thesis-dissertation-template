Changes by Mike Stark
---------------------
Dec, 2008

-Rename bsuthesis.cls to bsu-ms.cls to keep older name
-bsuthesis.cls is the new classfile for now.  We can change the name
later, if necessary.

For the most part, I just reorganized everything.  In particular I
replaced most of the customized stuff in the ``monolithic'' copy of
'report.cls' with macros that are defined in a ``CUSTOMIZED'' section
at the end of the file.  Also, I restructured that copy so it is closer
to the original (this facilitates a `diff` to see where they differ)
I also pasted the 'size12.clo' code directly; the rationale is that
we want our thesis style to change as little as possible with future
releases of the LaTeX distribution.

Summary of changes:

  - I removed the extraneous package options, including the paper size, 
    two-column mode.  The document font size is now fixed at 12 point.
  
  - I removed the "\masterstype" macro and added a "report" option to
    the document class, and made whatever they type depends on work
    accordingly.  

  - There is a new \buildFrontPages command that constructs all the front
    matter pages.  The original front matter commands, such as \abstract, 
    \biosketch, etc., now just set macro values.  Consequently, they
    can go in the preamble.

  - I expanded the names of most of the front matter macros, to make them
    more like Java style names:

      \gmonth -> \graduationMonth
      \gyear  -> \graduationYear
      \cmteA  -> \committeeA          (etc.)

  - Commands for setting names that may also have a title, like the 
    committee members and advisor, accept an optional argument for the
    title.  (This facilitates things like Ex-Officio members).

  - There is some error checking: any required but undefined front matter
    definitions are reported.

  - All the stuff that was computer science specific has been removed
    from the "bsu-ms.cls" file and replaced by macro-setting commands.

  - I pasted the contents of "size12.clo" almost verbatim into this
    file.

  - I reverted much of the "monolithic paste" of "report.cls" to the
    original form (to make a `diff` with the original more useful).  
    Customization code has mostly been replaced by macros; there is a
    "%!" comment near each variation from "report.cls"

  - The title page now matches the requirements set forth in the 
    standards pretty well; in particular, the author's name is near
    the vertical center of the page.

  - Multiline titles no longer cause any trouble (provided they aren't
    more than 5 or 6 lines)

  - There is a \titleBreak command that can be used to break lines
    in the title on the title page only (it gets turned off before
    the approval page is produced.)

  - The document margins are now a little closer to the requirements,
    of 1 inch on the top, right, and bottom, and 1 1/2 inches at the
    left.

  - I've made the chapter and front matter page headings consistent.  
    They are all in 17 point bold font, in all capital letters, and
    all start 2 inches (to the point!) from the top of the page.
    (Really that requirement should be specified in terms of the heading
    text baseline, don't you think?)

  - The approval page now matches the example given in the standards
    document, with the reader's name at the left of the line (which is
    3.75 inches long) and the reader's position (e.g. Advisor) directly
    below it.  The example has a 3/4 inch space for each signature,
    which seems reasonable so I matched it.

  - For some reason, the author's name on the approval page was set
    in italics.  I changed that.

  - I added dotted line leaders to the chapter names, which includes
    things like the abstract.  Neither "report.cls" nor "book.cls" does
    that (I don't know why--it really looks better).  I also tightened
    the space between the dots from 4.5 to 2.5 (stored in \@TOCdotsep)

  - The table of contents formats the leaders to end at a fixed vertical
    position, which assumes there are three-digit page numbers.  That
    produces too much space if there are, say, only 98 pages.  Ideally
    we could use the .aux file to count the number of pages but that's
    pretty hard (unless you are willing to make a third pass).  So I
    added a \maxPage macro that uses the value to set the space for the
    page number.
  
  - The bibliography name is now properly contained in \bibname, which
    allows students to use "Bibliography" instead of "References" (this
    is necessary if they want to include entries not referenced anywhere
    in the text).

  - I added a couple of possibly useful commands and environments.  I
    didn't include my 'code' environment, which is complicated and not
    terribly robust, but I did add a 'vcode' environment that starts
    single spacing and also reduces the font a bit so that it blends
    better with the running text.  (The monospace "typewriter" font
    runs a bit wide and tends to look bigger than the normal Roman font.)
 
  - Finally, I added an "Amit" option, that uses "Chapter" instead
    of "CHAPTER" for chapter headings in the main text, and a "Mike"
    option that uses PostScript fonts (except Courier, which runs too
    wide for my taste).  That was more for fun; I don't think we need
    to publicize those!


Incidental changes:

  - The names of the front matter pages are all in macros.  I'm still
    not sure what the title of the approval page for a project should be:

      "Approval to submit project report"
      "Approval to submit report"
      "Approval to submit project"

  - The chapter names are capitalized in the table of contents, so that
    they match the format in the headings (although the font size is
    a notch smaller).

  - The title page is now page 1, as is the blank page in front of it.
    (I considered taking out the blank first and last pages, but I think
    it's better to have them in.  Good idea, whoever put them there!)

  - I opened up the space inserted into the list of tables (figures) 
    between chapters from 10 points to 12 points.  (I was surprised that
    the value did not depend on the font size.)

  - I'm sure there are many more; these are all I can remember.

I spent a fair amount of time (way too much, actually) working on the
problem of calling a single appendix just "Appendix" rather than 
"Appendix A".  The tricky part is doing it without requiring a third
LaTeX pass.  I found two solutions, both requiring some extra .aux
file output.  But then I realized that it's probably not a good idea, 
because labels for figures and equations in the appendix have to have 
some prefix for their label, and "A" is as good as any, right?  Hmm, I
just realized that we can still use "A" as prefix, but not name the
appendix "Appendix A".  I'll come back to that...
